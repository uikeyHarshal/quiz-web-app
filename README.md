## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Questions are stored as JavaScript objects.
2. JavaScript dynamically renders:
   - Questions
   - Answer buttons
3. User selection:
   - Highlights correct and incorrect answers
   - Disables other options
4. Score is updated in real time.
5. At the end:
   - Final score is displayed
   - User can restart the quiz.
